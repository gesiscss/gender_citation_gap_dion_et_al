## Replication: Dion, Sumner, Mitchell (2018): Gendered Citation Patterns across Political Science and Social Science Methodology Fields


This repository entails the code and data to replicate the published Article ["Gendered Citation Patterns across Political Science and Social Science Methodology Fields" by Dion, Sumner and Mitchell (2018)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/gendered-citation-patterns-across-political-science-and-social-science-methodology-fields/5E8E92DB7454BCAE41A912F9E792CBA7) and the structure to explore the replication interactively using Binder. 


### Installation
You can easily access the replication files via Binder and explore the replication in the document "Replication_Dion_et_al_Walkthrough.ipynb".

### Structure

- **Binder** entails all the required files to launch the repository interactively in Binder.
- **Data** entails the datasets used for the replication as downloaded from [Havard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/R7AQT1)
- **renv** entails code necessary to set up a virtual R environment to make the analysis more easily replicable (for more info, see respective Github Repo [renv](https://github.com/rstudio/renv)
- **sources** entails the R-source files that estimate the regression coefficients and produce the regression table.
