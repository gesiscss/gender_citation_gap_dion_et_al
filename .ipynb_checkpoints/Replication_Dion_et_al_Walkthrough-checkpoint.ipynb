    "# Replication: Dion, Sumner, Mitchell (2018): Gendered Citation Patterns across Political Science and Social Science Methodology Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Notebook will guide the reader through the replication of a quantitative analysis by Dion, Sumner and Mitchell from their article [**Gendered Citation Patterns across Political Science and Social Science Methodology Fields**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/gendered-citation-patterns-across-political-science-and-social-science-methodology-fields/5E8E92DB7454BCAE41A912F9E792CBA7). It will allow an interactive exploration of the authors' analysis of citation patterns in social science journals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first section, I describe the main argument of the authors. Further on, I will guide through the analysis of the dataset used in the article and show the necessary steps to reproduce the Tables 1 to 3 in the article. I will conclude this replication with short comments on the argument and the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In the publication in **Political Analysis**, Dion, Sumner and Mitchell (2018) aim to explain the gender biased citation behaviour in the social sciences. Building on prior research adressing the gender citation gap in different scientific disciplines. While other researchers examine differences in citation behaviour of male and female researchers over entire academic careers, Dion et al. (2018) approach the topic from a network-approach, in other words, they analyse \"who cites whom?\", rather than meremly asking \"who is cited the most?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Their aim is to model the probability with which the authorship of a referenced article in a social science journal is entirely composed of female researchers vs. solely male or researchers of both sexes. And the main explanatory factor of this variable is the sex of the author(s) citing the respective article (male vs. female vs. mixed sex). A presence of such an effect could already be shown by other researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinct argument of article by Dion et al. (2018) is to analyse whether this effect is differently pronounced when there are more female researchers active within a field of social science. They hypothesise that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- H1: the effect of the sex of citing authors on the sex of the cited author will be more strongly pronounced in  methodological fields of political science, because there are fewer female researcher active in these fields.\n",
    "- H2: the effect of the sex of citing authors on the sex of the cited author will be more strongly pronounced in fields of Social science with fewer active female researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They select five journals (APSR, Politics \\& Gender, Econometrica, Political Analysis, Sociological Methods \\& Research) as representatives of fields with higher share of female (Politics \\& Gender) and higher share of male  researchers (Political Analysis). Via comparing methodological journals from Economics (Econometrica), Sociology (SMR) and Political Science (Political Analysis) they aim to show these patterns across social science disciplines with economics being a field more dominated by men than political science and sociology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, I guide through the replication of the analysis by Dion et al.  (2018).\n",

    "Whereas the authors use a large amount of data to analyse the effect of a scholar (group)'s sex on citing the article of a female researcher or research group, the testing of the hypothesis solely consists of comparing pairs of effect sizes from 5 models. Hence, although there is evidence of gender biased citation behaviour in social science journals, the evidence for a \"Mathilda-effect\", a moderation of this effect based on the share of female researchers in a given field/ publishing in a given journal is yet rather weak. To analyse this effect using an interaction between the no. of female researchers in a given field and the effect could yield more insights.\n",
