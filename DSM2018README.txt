This README file includes instructions for replicating the results in: 
Dion, Michelle L., Jane Lawrence Sumner, and Sara McLaughlin Mitchell. "Gendered Citation Patterns across Political Science and Social Science Methodology Fields." Political Analysis.   

Users should also consult the Supplemental Materials (Appendix) posted online for a narrative description of the data collection process. 

Users who use the replication code should cite the replication materials: 
Dion, Michelle; Sumner, Jane Lawrence; Mitchell, Sara McLaughlin, 2018, "Replication Data for: Gendered Citation Patterns across Political Science and Social Science Methodology Fields", doi:10.7910/DVN/R7AQT1, Harvard Dataverse.

Note that "article author" refers to an author of the original article record from Web of Science, and "reference author" refers to an author of a cited reference in an article. 

Replication of paper and appendix results requires Stata and packages referenced in the .do files.

PAPER DATA ANALYSIS FILES
These are the replication files with the variables and data necessary to reproduce our paper results using Stata. 
2. DSM2018Preplication.do - Code to reproduce all the Tables and Figures from the published article. 
3. DSM2018PAreplication.dta - Data necessary for Tables 2-3 and Figures 1-2. 
4. DSM2018PAreplication_articlesonly.dta - Data necessary for Table 1.

PAPER DATA ANALYSIS 
DSM2018Preplication.do
************************************************************************************
We provide the recoded data files with the information necessary to replicate the results in the paper: 
a. DSM2018PAreplication.dta - Data necessary for Tables 2-3 and Figures 1-2. 
b. DSM2018PAreplication_articlesonly.dta - Data necessary for Table 1. 
The results for Tables 1 and 2 will appear in the Stata results window, and Table 3 will be saved as a .txt file. The .tif files will be large (1.3 GB) due to their resolution. The .do file includes code (commented out) that will also save the figures as Stata graph files.
